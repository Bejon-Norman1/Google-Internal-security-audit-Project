# Conducting an Internal Security Audit for Botium Toys

For this project, Google provided a scenario where I will be conducting an internal security audit for Botium Toys, a small U.S. business specializing in toy development and sales. The company has experienced significant growth in its online presence, attracting customers both domestically and internationally. As a result, the IT department is under increasing pressure to support the expanding online market. To ensure business continuity, compliance, and a secure infrastructure, the manager of the IT department has decided to initiate an internal IT audit.

# Project Scope and Goals
The IT manager has implemented the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) as the foundation for this audit. The primary objectives of the internal audit are as follows:

1.) Identify potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets within the company's infrastructure.

2.) Assess the current state of security posture and determine areas for improvement.

3.) Ensure compliance with regulations pertaining to accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).

You receive the following email from your IT manager:

Hello!

I have completed the audit scope and goals, as well as a risk assessment. At a high level, the main goals and risks are as follows:

Goals:

* Provide mitigation recommendations (i.e., controls, policies, documentation), based on current risks

* Identify compliance regulations Botium Toys must adhere to, primarily based on where we conduct business and how we accept payments

* To review the full report, read the Botium Toys: Audit scope and goals document

Risks:

* Inadequate management of assets

* Proper controls are not in place

* May not be compliant with U.S. and international regulations and guidelines

Thank you,
Botium Toys IT Manager

After thoroughly examining the audit scope, goals, and risk assessment, I have provided my insights and responses to the following questions, which were provided by Google:

1. What are the biggest risks to the organization?

  * Inadequate management of assets: The lack of proper asset management practices poses a significant risk to Botium Toys. It can result in inefficiencies, data loss, unauthorized access, and compromise the overall security of the company's infrastructure.

  * Insufficient controls: The absence of essential controls leaves Botium Toys vulnerable to various threats. It increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical assets, malware infections, and data breaches. Without proper controls in place, the company's systems and data are more susceptible to compromise.

  * Non-compliance with regulations: Botium Toys needs to ensure compliance with relevant regulations to protect customer and vendor data, avoid fines, and maintain a good reputation. The company expresses concerns about complying with U.S. and international regulations and guidelines, particularly related to accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).

2. Which controls are most essential to implement immediately versus in the future?

3. Which compliance regulations does Botium Toys need to adhere to, to ensure the company keeps customer and vendor data safe, avoids fines, etc.?
