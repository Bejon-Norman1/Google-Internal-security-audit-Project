# Conducting an Internal Security Audit for Botium Toys

For this project, Google provided a scenario where I will be conducting an internal security audit for Botium Toys, a small U.S. business specializing in toy development and sales. The company has experienced significant growth in its online presence, attracting customers both domestically and internationally. As a result, the IT department is under increasing pressure to support the expanding online market. To ensure business continuity, compliance, and a secure infrastructure, the manager of the IT department has decided to initiate an internal IT audit.
