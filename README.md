# Conducting an Internal Security Audit for Botium Toys

For this project, Google provided a scenario where I will be conducting an internal security audit for Botium Toys, a small U.S. business specializing in toy development and sales. The company has experienced significant growth in its online presence, attracting customers both domestically and internationally. As a result, the IT department is under increasing pressure to support the expanding online market. To ensure business continuity, compliance, and a secure infrastructure, the manager of the IT department has decided to initiate an internal IT audit.

# Project Scope and Goals
The IT manager has implemented the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) as the foundation for this audit. The primary objectives of the internal audit are as follows:

1.) Identify potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets within the company's infrastructure.

2.) Assess the current state of security posture and determine areas for improvement.

3.) Ensure compliance with regulations pertaining to accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).

# Scenario 

You receive the following email from your IT manager:

Hello!

I have completed the audit scope and goals, as well as a risk assessment. At a high level, the main goals and risks are as follows:

Goals:

* Improve Botium Toys’ current security posture by aligning to industry best practices (e.g., adhere to the NIST CSF, implement concept of least permissions)

* Provide mitigation recommendations (i.e., controls, policies, documentation), based on current risks

* Identify compliance regulations Botium Toys must adhere to, primarily based on where we conduct business and how we accept payments

* To review the full report, read the Botium Toys: Audit scope and goals document

Risks:

* Inadequate management of assets

* Proper controls are not in place

* May not be compliant with U.S. and international regulations and guidelines

* Current risk score is 8/10 (high), due to a lack of controls and adherence to compliance regulations and standards

* To review the complete list of assets and risks, read the Botium Toys: Risk assessment document 


Thank you,
Botium Toys IT Manager

After thoroughly examining the audit scope, goals, and risk assessment, I have provided my insights and responses to the following questions, which were provided by Google:

1). What are the biggest risks to the organization?

  * <b>Inadequate management of assets:</b> The lack of proper asset management practices poses a significant risk to Botium Toys. It can result in inefficiencies, data loss, unauthorized access, and compromise the overall security of the company's infrastructure.

  * <b>Insufficient controls:</b> The absence of essential controls leaves Botium Toys vulnerable to various threats. It increases the risk of unauthorized access to critical assets, malware infections, and data breaches. Without proper controls in place, the company's systems and data are more susceptible to compromise.

  * <b>Non-compliance with regulations:</b> Botium Toys needs to ensure compliance with relevant regulations to protect customer and vendor data, avoid fines, and maintain a good reputation. The company expresses concerns about complying with U.S. and international regulations and guidelines, particularly related to accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).

2). Which controls are most essential to implement immediately versus in the future?

  *  <b>Asset management:</b> Establish a comprehensive asset management system to track and manage all company assets, including hardware, software, and data. This control helps ensure accountability, identify vulnerabilities, and maintain an up-to-date inventory of assets.

  *  <b>Access controls:</b> Implement robust access controls across the company's systems and applications. This includes strong authentication mechanisms, role-based access controls (RBAC), and regular review of user access privileges. Adequate access controls prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing sensitive information and systems.

  *  <b>Patch management:</b> Develop and enforce a patch management process to keep software and systems up to date with the latest security patches. Regular patching reduces the risk of known vulnerabilities being exploited by attackers.

  *  <b>Network security:</b> Implement network security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), and network segmentation. These controls help protect the company's network infrastructure from unauthorized access, malware, and other network-based attacks.

While these controls should be implemented immediately, it's important to recognize that security is an ongoing process. Some controls that may be essential for future implementation include:

  *  <b>Security awareness training:</b> Conduct regular security awareness training sessions for employees to educate them about security best practices, social engineering attacks, and their roles and responsibilities in maintaining a secure environment.

  *  <b>Incident response plan:</b> Develop an incident response plan to address and mitigate security incidents effectively. This plan should outline the steps to be taken during an incident, including incident identification, containment, eradication, and recovery.

  *  <b>Encryption and data protection:</b> Implement encryption mechanisms to protect sensitive data at rest and in transit. This control ensures that customer and vendor data remains secure even if it is compromised or intercepted.

3). Which compliance regulations does Botium Toys need to adhere to, to ensure the company keeps customer and vendor data safe, avoids fines, etc.?

  *  <b>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS):</b> If Botium Toys accepts payment cards, it must comply with PCI DSS requirements. This standard ensures the secure handling, processing, and storage of payment card information.

  *  <b>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):</b> If Botium Toys conducts business with customers located in the European Union (E.U.), it must adhere to GDPR guidelines. GDPR focuses on protecting the personal data of individuals within the E.U., including consent management, data protection, and privacy rights.

  # Internal Audit Process

  The internal audit process will consist of two main components: controls assessment and compliance checklist.

  # Control Assessment 

  The controls assessment phase will involve a thorough review of the company's existing security controls. Such as:
  
 1. Reviewing the list of Botium Toys’ assets
  
 2. Reviewing each control name 
  
 3. Reviewing the control types and explanation  

 4. Marking an X next to each control that needs to be implemented

 5. Note levels of priority (high, medium, and/or low; NA if not applicable)

# Compliance Checklist 

To address the company's compliance requirements, a compliance checklist will be developed. I will select the compliance regulations and standards that Botium Toys needs to adhere to and explain why the company needs to adhere to the selected compliance regulations and standards.
