# Conducting an Internal Security Audit for Botium Toys

For this project, Google provided a scenario where I will be conducting an internal security audit for Botium Toys, a small U.S. business specializing in toy development and sales. The company has experienced significant growth in its online presence, attracting customers both domestically and internationally. As a result, the IT department is under increasing pressure to support the expanding online market. To ensure business continuity, compliance, and a secure infrastructure, the manager of the IT department has decided to initiate an internal IT audit.

# Project Scope and Goals
The IT manager has implemented the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) as the foundation for this audit. The primary objectives of the internal audit are as follows:

1.) Identify potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets within the company's infrastructure.

2.) Assess the current state of security posture and determine areas for improvement.

3.) Ensure compliance with regulations pertaining to accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).

You receive the following email from your IT manager:

Hello!

I have completed the audit scope and goals, as well as a risk assessment. At a high level, the main goals and risks are as follows:

Goals:

Improve Botium Toysâ€™ current security posture by aligning to industry best practices (e.g., adhere to the NIST CSF, implement concept of least permissions)

Provide mitigation recommendations (i.e., controls, policies, documentation), based on current risks

Identify compliance regulations Botium Toys must adhere to, primarily based on where we conduct business and how we accept payments
